Web scraping and data analysis project using BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and Pandas. Scrapes Mars news articles and weather data, then cleans, analyzes, and visualizes results.

Description
This project was completed as part of the GWU Data Analytics Bootcamp’s web scraping module. It is split into two Jupyter Notebooks:

Part 1 – Mars News Scraper

Uses Splinter and BeautifulSoup to visit the Mars News site, extract article titles and previews, and store results in Python dictionaries.

Saves the scraped data to a list and optionally exports it to JSON for sharing.

Part 2 – Mars Weather Data Scraper & Analysis

Scrapes tabular weather data from the Mars Temperature Data site using BeautifulSoup.

Loads the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame, cleans and converts data types, and answers analytical questions (e.g., coldest/warmest months, atmospheric pressure trends).

Generates bar charts and visualizations, exporting them as JPEGs.

Saves the cleaned dataset in both CSV and JSON formats.

This project strengthened skills in HTML parsing, automated browser navigation, and transforming scraped data into actionable insights. While not directly used in my current SQL-driven role, it provided a solid foundation for applying web scraping techniques in future projects.
